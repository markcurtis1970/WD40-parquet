I'll help you create a system to generate multiple parquet files based on a configuration file. Let me first explore the current workspace to understand the existing structure and then create a comprehensive solution.

Since this is an empty workspace, I'll create a complete solution from scratch. Let me design a system that uses a configuration file to control parquet file generation with customizable schemas, file parameters, and output specifications.

Let me start by creating the configuration schema and then build the parquet generation system. First, I'll create a comprehensive configuration file structure:

Now let me create the core parquet generator module:

The core data generation utilities are already included in the main module. Let me create additional utilities for more advanced data generation patterns:

Now let me create the CLI interface:

Now let me create several example configuration files for different use cases:

Now let me create the documentation and setup files:

Perfect! I've created a comprehensive parquet file generation system. Let me provide you with a summary of what has been built and demonstrate how to use it.

## Summary

I've created a complete system for generating multiple parquet files with configurable schemas and parameters. Here's what's included:

### Core Components

1. **`parquet_generator.py`** - Main generator class with data generation utilities
2. **`data_generators.py`** - Advanced data generators for realistic patterns
3. **`cli.py`** - Command-line interface for easy usage
4. **Configuration system** - YAML-based configuration for complete control

### Example Configurations

I've created several example configurations in the `examples/` directory:
- **Simple config** - Basic example to get started
- **E-commerce** - Transaction data with realistic distributions  
- **IoT sensors** - Time-series sensor data
- **Financial** - Trading data with market patterns

### Key Features

- **Multiple data types**: int32/64, float32/64, string, boolean, timestamp, UUID
- **Realistic data generation**: Normal distributions, choices with weights, sequences, date ranges
- **Flexible file parameters**: Compression types, row group sizes, file counts
- **Multiple file configurations**: Generate different file sets in one run
- **CLI tools**: Generate, validate, inspect, and list files

Let me demonstrate the system by running a quick test:

Let me try with python3:

The dependencies need to be installed first. Let me show you how to use the system:

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Basic Usage

Generate parquet files using one of the example configurations:

### 3. CLI Commands

Once dependencies are installed, you can use these commands:

**Generate files:**
```bash
python3 cli.py generate --config examples/simple_config.yaml
```

**Validate configuration:**
```bash
python3 cli.py validate --config examples/simple_config.yaml
```

**List generated files:**
```bash
python3 cli.py list --output-dir ./output
```

**Inspect a specific file:**
```bash
python3 cli.py info --file ./output/simple_data_001.parquet
```

### 4. Configuration Options

The system supports extensive configuration options:

````yaml path=config_schema.yaml mode=EXCERPT
# Global settings for the generation process
global:
  output_directory: "./output"
  file_prefix: "data"
  random_seed: 42  # For reproducible data generation
  
# Define the schema for the parquet files
schema:
  columns:
    - name: "id"
      type: "int64"
      nullable: false
      generator:
        type: "sequence"
        start: 1
````

### 5. Data Generator Types

The system supports various data generation patterns:

- **Sequence**: Sequential integers
- **UUID**: Unique identifiers
- **DateTime Range**: Random timestamps within a range
- **Normal Distribution**: Gaussian distributed numbers
- **Choice**: Random selection from a list with optional weights
- **Boolean**: Random true/false with configurable probability
- **Uniform Integer**: Random integers within a range

### 6. Advanced Features

- **Multiple file configurations**: Generate different file sets with different parameters
- **Size variation**: Add randomness to file sizes
- **Nullable columns**: Control null value probability
- **Various compression types**: snappy, gzip, lz4, brotli
- **Configurable parquet parameters**: row group size, page size, dictionary encoding

## Example Use Cases

I've included configurations for common scenarios:

1. **E-commerce transactions** (`examples/ecommerce_config.yaml`)
2. **IoT sensor data** (`examples/iot_sensor_config.yaml`) 
3. **Financial trading data** (`examples/financial_config.yaml`)

Each demonstrates different data patterns and realistic distributions for testing and development purposes.

The system is ready to use once you install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`. Would you like me to create any additional configurations or modify any existing features?
